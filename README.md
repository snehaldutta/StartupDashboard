# ðŸ“Š Startup Success Prediction Dashboard

A Streamlit-based web application that predicts the success probability of a startup using machine learning. Users can input startup-related features and receive a success/failure prediction along with confidence and insights about industry funding trends.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

Startups are inherently risky. This project builds a **Startup Success Classifier** trained on real-world startup data, and wraps it in a **user-friendly Streamlit dashboard**. Users can interactively input details like funding, team experience, and founding year to understand the likelihood of startup success.
